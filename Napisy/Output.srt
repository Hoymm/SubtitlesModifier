1
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,803
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

2
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,118
- I was set up.
- Swear to me.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,386
I swear to you, Michael.

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,723
Put down your weapon!

5
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:22,157
I find it incumbent that

6
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:23,726
you see the inside of a prison cell,

7
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:25,120
Mr. Scofield.

8
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:27,262
I'm looking for someone...
Guy named Lincoln Burrows.

9
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:29,341
Why you want to see
Burrows so bad anyhow?

10
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:30,499
'Cause he's my brother.

11
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:33,102
- I'm getting you out of here.
- That's impossible.

12
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:35,237
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

13
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,173
You one mixed-up cracker,

14
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:39,208
you know that?

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,442
Are we in business?

16
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:43,012
Now... it's all about timing.

17
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,749
Scofield. You just
as pretty as advertised.

18
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,149
When do we get started?

19
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,385
- I need your help.
- You're asking me to break the law.

20
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:50,986
I'm asking you to make a mistake.

21
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:52,788
Forget to lock up.

22
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,357
Come on.

23
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,229
We did it, Mike.

24
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:03,699
However this plays out...

25
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,301
I have no regrets.

26
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:06,718
Michael!

27
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,080
Well, if you're watching
this, that means you're safe.

28
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,942
I wish I could be there with you,

29
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:16,211
but as you know now, I
wouldn't have had much time.

30
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:17,846
I made my choice.

31
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:19,315
I don't regret it.

32
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,317
We're free now.

33
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,446
We're free.

34
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,048
_

35
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:30,492
Freedom has a price.

36
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:38,233
I died seven years ago.

37
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:40,869
Left behind a brother...

38
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:43,572
a wife...

39
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:45,074
a son.

40
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:49,778
But the dead talk...

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,147
if you listen.

42
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:56,485
They're there with you...

43
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:58,887
reaching out...

44
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:01,924
trying to tell you something.

45
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:04,693
Because not all deaths are the same.

46
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,030
Some are real.

47
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:10,199
Some are a story.

48
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,915
Question is...

49
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:16,205
do you believe the story?

50
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,993
Was the man who died

51
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:22,311
who you thought he was?

52
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:25,080
The dead talk...

53
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,016
if you listen.

54
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,295
_

55
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,327
Still tight as...

56
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,295
scales on a snake.

57
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,098
Must have friends in
high places, Bagwell.

58
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,402
How a cesspool like you gets his
walking papers I'll never know.

59
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:51,440
This cesspool has been a model citizen.

60
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,290
Model citizen.

61
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:59,014
$71.31.

62
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:01,584
Laptop.

63
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:03,452
Pack of gum, three pieces.

64
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:05,287
How about you keep that?

65
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,289
Whatever you bring in, you bring out.

66
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,826
And one last piece of correspondence.

67
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:15,214
Something really wrong with
the world when I'm receiving

68
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:17,166
dozens of letters a
week for guys like you.

69
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:20,469
Nothing compared to the e-mails.

70
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,638
What is it with you
killers that put the satin

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,239
on women's panties anyhow?

72
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,155
Lackaday!

73
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,524
_

74
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,179
Burrows!

75
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,381
How about you step out and pay us

76
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:08,617
the hundred grand you owe us?

77
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:11,904
Take that as a no.

78
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:14,289
Lincoln Burrows...

79
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,858
says no.

80
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,994
Big tough guy...

81
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:21,196
who made it out of the neighborhood.

82
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:23,899
And look at you now...
Back to your roots,

83
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,667
the way you've always been.

84
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,338
A small-time crook who
can't pay his debts.

85
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,240
We're gonna find you, you know,

86
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:33,369
and we're gonna open you up.

87
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,892
Lincolny-linc.

88
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:52,795
All huffin' and puffin'.

89
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:55,773
Don't you look at me like I'm trash.

90
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:58,343
My house is in order. I'm
clear with the government,

91
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,211
the D.O.C. and my God.

92
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,180
Doesn't appear to be the same with you.

93
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,082
Look at you, all backslid.

94
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,551
You're supposed to be going
up in the world as you age,

95
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,386
or did you not get the memo?

96
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:11,356
You don't get off my deck,
I'm gonna crack your skull.

97
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,857
I wouldn't do that.

98
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,826
Seems fate has deigned

99
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:17,462
to join us at the hip once again,

100
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:20,398
despite our mutual contempt.

101
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:27,038
Have a look-see.

102
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,752
Where'd you get this?

103
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,988
Received it on release
earlier this week.

104
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,556
No return address.

105
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:48,226
If you're playing me, I'll kill you.

106
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:50,395
Take a look at that postmark on that.

107
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,665
I may be a sophisti-cat,

108
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,467
but not so sophisticated

109
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,635
as to forge something like that.

110
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,172
Besides...

111
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:04,609
what angle could I
possibly have in coming here

112
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,511
and telling you that it
looks like your brother

113
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:09,080
might just be alive?

114
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:44,720
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

115
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,259
It's impossible.

116
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:51,503
That's what I thought.

117
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,104
Why'd he send it to you?

118
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:55,106
Again, what I thought.

119
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,443
And then I gave the
words another look-see.

120
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:00,412
Maybe that's the answer.

121
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,783
"By your hand

122
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,785
you shall know the
glories of your Progeny

123
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:09,220
and our world will be

124
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,090
made right forevermore."

125
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:14,292
Hell if I know what that means.

126
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:16,728
But just like that
envelope's addressed to me,

127
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,106
those words are addressed
to me. Got to be!

128
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:19,898
Get out.

129
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,633
I'm trying to work with you here.

130
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,875
Is there any possible way
your brother could've survived?

131
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,106
My brother's dead.

132
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,508
Th-Then who sent this? And why?

133
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,578
Get out.

134
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:39,751
Least let me take my
rightful correspondence.

135
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,511
Oh, I made a copy, Burrows.

136
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:48,581
I knew you'd be the same
obstinate son of a beyotch

137
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,651
you always been, but I'd
hoped you'd seen the light.

138
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,764
But you are what you is
and you is what you are.

139
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,469
Still, I'm telling you...

140
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:00,438
fate has got us joined
at the hip somehow.

141
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,631
Where you in from?

142
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,662
Chicago.

143
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:26,498
Love Chicago.

144
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,634
- There you go.
- Thanks, man.

145
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,449
I didn't think

146
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,418
I was ever gonna see you again.

147
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,821
You didn't come to the wedding.

148
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:25,190
I mean, I figured I... I get it...

149
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:28,126
He hates me for marrying someone
other than his brother, but...

150
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,963
I haven't been in a good place, Sara.

151
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:35,338
My brain, it's... it's been a mess.

152
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,835
That's why I didn't show up.

153
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:40,405
And... I didn't want my
nephew to see me like that.

154
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:45,276
But now it's impossible to stay away.

155
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,279
Someone's got a sick sense of humor.

156
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:51,490
I know you want it to be true.

157
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,226
Losing a brother...

158
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,596
The massive hole that
leaves in your life.

159
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:58,532
Like the same massive
hole losing a husband is.

160
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,072
Maybe.

161
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,640
Lincoln Burrows?

162
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:07,708
Jacob.

163
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,010
I haven't seen you in what,

164
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:09,926
three, four years?

165
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,178
- Yeah.
- Uncle Lincoln!

166
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,381
Hey-hey! Buddy!

167
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:14,849
Oh...

168
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,517
so good to see you.

169
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,186
Did you bring me any sunken treasures?

170
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,822
Sunken treasures?

171
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:23,792
Oh. The dive shop.

172
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,793
- Panama.
- Yeah, I've been telling him stories

173
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:28,662
about being down there before
we came back to the States.

174
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:30,131
You've become kind of like

175
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,690
a mythological hero to
him. Let me get some beers.

176
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:35,236
- I want to know what you been up to. Okay.
- Sure, man. Yeah.

177
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:36,670
Come here.

178
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,506
I want you to go wash up, okay?

179
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:41,039
And then you can catch
up with your uncle.

180
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:46,847
He hasn't just mythologized you.

181
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,649
He mythologizes Michael, too.

182
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,552
It's like someone thinking
he was born to a god,

183
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,988
a god he's never met...

184
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,457
and who isn't here.

185
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,361
And who never will be again.

186
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,898
I can be pragmatic.

187
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,267
Michael was sick.

188
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,669
He was terminally sick,

189
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,172
and he died.

190
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:20,974
Sara...

191
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:23,084
how do you explain that?

192
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:29,090
It's Photoshop, Linc,

193
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:31,058
or something.

194
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,761
You got to consider the source.

195
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:36,297
This came from T-Bag.

196
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,334
I know you want it to be true.

197
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:43,234
I want it to be true.

198
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,947
How about a date tonight, model citizen?

199
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:57,051
A little well-earned love

200
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,086
after a long time at sea.

201
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:01,422
Jeh... boop.

202
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,491
Miss Dorothy.

203
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,960
E-mailing her undying love

204
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:09,263
from Aurora, Illinois.

205
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,595
I-eesh.

206
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:14,401
How about this one?

207
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:17,872
"Love Cannon Alonzo in Champaign."

208
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,808
Ooh. Hop on that just on the name alone.

209
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,449
- _
- What the hell?

210
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:28,020
Prosthetic research?

211
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:41,219
Smart girl, your Sara.

212
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,620
She's right.

213
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:45,523
I'm just desperate to see your face.

214
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:49,927
My life's been a mess
ever since you left.

215
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:52,430
Fallen back into my old ways.

216
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:55,400
Something you wouldn't tolerate.

217
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,802
But I got good in me, Michael.

218
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,104
I got good in me.

219
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,675
It'd just be nice if

220
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:08,079
you were here to... help me find it.

221
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,085
So... yeah.

222
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,609
"Ogygia."

223
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,455
Telling me where you are.

224
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,318
There's only one way to find out.

225
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:24,489
Theodore Bagwell.

226
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:27,992
And you're Dr. Whitcombe,

227
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:30,795
the man who invited me
to this mystery meeting

228
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:35,600
at 9:30 at night when the
rest of the building's closed.

229
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,602
I know what you've done.

230
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:40,571
That's why I don't want to be
seen associating with your sort.

231
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,740
Just want to know why I'm here, and...

232
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:45,176
if this has anything to do
with that special envelope

233
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,477
I received in the prison.

234
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,779
I know nothing about an envelope.

235
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:51,449
I can only tell you my work.

236
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:54,051
Targeted muscle reinnervation.

237
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,088
Using the brain to manipulate prosthesis

238
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,956
as it were a natural limb.

239
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,892
But as with any cutting-edge work,

240
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,694
funding is not easy to find, and yet,

241
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,563
incredibly, I got the grant

242
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,143
in the form of a
considerable anonymous grant

243
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,200
on one condition...

244
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:12,837
The first recipient of my procedure...

245
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,639
is you.

246
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,410
I can equip you

247
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,812
with a fully articulate prosthetic,

248
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,448
operationally indistinguishable
from a real hand.

249
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,020
All of this because
of an anonymous donor?

250
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:31,389
Someone seems to have
plans for both of us.

251
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:34,392
I've reserved an
operational lab for Monday

252
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,061
if you decide you are interested.

253
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,996
It's your hand, ultimately.

254
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,943
By your hand,

255
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:56,881
you shall know glories of your progeny.

256
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,483
What's that?

257
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:03,578
Nothing, Doc.

258
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:53,604
Come on, Michael.

259
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:55,539
You must have left me something.

260
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,307
Come on!

261
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:02,913
Come on.

262
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,325
What's going on?

263
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,617
Oh, my God, what happened?

264
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,519
I'm not sure. I'm gonna call

265
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:52,856
the police.

266
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,007
Hello?

267
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,600
I dug up Michael's
grave. He's not in it.

268
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:13,759
He... What?

269
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,579
Sara, someone just tried to kill me.

270
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:16,847
They've been watching.
They've been watching,

271
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,728
- probably for...
- Who tried to kill you?

272
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:20,183
It started at the airport. I...

273
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,552
There was a... a red sedan.

274
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:23,854
It started following me.

275
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,889
Then they... they... they swapped

276
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,257
down to a...

277
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,192
What was it? A pickup.

278
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:33,797
What color was the pickup?

279
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,249
Black.

280
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:36,767
Why?

281
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:38,068
Sara?

282
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,302
Jacob?

283
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,038
- Yeah.
- Behind one of

284
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,607
the pictures on the brick wall,
there's a hole, and there's

285
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,509
- a gun in it. I need you to get it.
- What?!

286
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,826
Right now! Right now!
Someone's coming for us!

287
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,201
A gun? What do you mean, a gun?

288
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,123
Mike?

289
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,565
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

290
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:57,721
I have an armed intruder in the house.

291
00:19:57,723 --> 00:19:58,855
I need you to send people right away.

292
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,891
I don't have time. Please, come.

293
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:04,428
- Mike?
- Sara?

294
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,863
What's going on, Sara?

295
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,068
Hey.

296
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:12,102
- Mom?
- Come here.

297
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,827
Sara? Sara!

298
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,199
It's just me. There's
no one else in the house.

299
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,701
- What do you want?
- Get in the tub.

300
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:48,805
Who's here, Mom? What do they want?

301
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,577
I don't know, baby.

302
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:04,688
Okay, listen to me, if anyone comes

303
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,923
through that door, you don't move, okay?

304
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,559
I will put this through them,
and you will not be harmed.

305
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,729
You understand? Good boy.

306
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:44,194
Jacob?

307
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,663
Mom.

308
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:48,165
Go get every towel you can find.

309
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,633
Right now, right now.

310
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,815
Please, Jacob.

311
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:53,536
Okay. I think it got an artery.

312
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,372
Stay with me. I want you
to look at me, all right?

313
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,549
Don't close your eyes and
don't go to sleep, all right?

314
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,442
I'm gonna need you to stay with me.

315
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,043
I need an ambulance!

316
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:12,012
- How is he?
- The shot almost completely

317
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:14,314
severed his femoral artery so
they're trying to stabilize him.

318
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:15,816
And him?

319
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,151
He's seven.

320
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,491
How you doing, Mikey?

321
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,026
Something's happening, isn't it?

322
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,394
First, you come

323
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,464
and that person came in our house.

324
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:34,568
It has something to do with
my real father, doesn't it?

325
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,036
Why do you say that?

326
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,872
Because I can see it in her face.

327
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:45,790
I'm gonna need to talk to your uncle.

328
00:22:45,793 --> 00:22:47,414
I'm gonna be right over there

329
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,217
where you can see me. Okay?

330
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,323
What's going on?

331
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,991
We've awoken something.

332
00:22:57,993 --> 00:22:59,893
Something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

333
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:01,328
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.

334
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,597
Or is he dead? Where is the body?

335
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,200
Then why did he leave?

336
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:09,770
If he's been out there
for all of these years,

337
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:12,139
why did he abandon his own son?

338
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,074
You know I'm right.

339
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:16,243
It wouldn't be like this if
something wasn't happening.

340
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:18,345
- It wouldn't, but...
- Let's fight back.

341
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:19,846
I don't know who we're fighting.

342
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,248
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

343
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,991
To Yemen? I have a son, Lincoln.

344
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:26,686
My husband's in the ER. Right?
Look, leaving them is exactly

345
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:28,628
the wrong thing for me to do right now.

346
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,621
Ma'am. He's ready to see you.

347
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,593
One second.

348
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,674
I'll do it.

349
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,676
I'll go to Yemen.

350
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:42,011
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

351
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,113
I'll find someone who does.

352
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,584
See ya, Mikey.

353
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,191
_

354
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,571
I envy you.

355
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,673
You changed your life around.

356
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:14,477
A man gets tired of
living a profligate life.

357
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,825
So I took up jihad. Real jihad,

358
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:21,184
not that madness that
you see on the news.

359
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:22,924
War within.

360
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:27,590
The spiritual struggle
to clean up your act.

361
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,692
Finding and serving God.

362
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,697
That's good, man.

363
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,799
The world needs it, Linc.

364
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,601
I mean we're, uh, we're small here

365
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,137
but we do what we can

366
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,373
to help the peace efforts
in the Middle East.

367
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:47,043
Working on anti-radicalization
campaigns here at home.

368
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:50,046
Like I said, the struggle.

369
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,782
That's why I'm here.

370
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,984
If I needed to get to Yemen,

371
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:56,686
that something you could help me with?

372
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,426
I thought he was dead.

373
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,797
So did everyone.

374
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,565
But Ogygia?

375
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:09,999
I mean, that's for heavy hitters,

376
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,234
political prisoners.

377
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:13,736
In Yemen, it doesn't come any worse.

378
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:16,406
I mean, do you know what it
would take to stage a death?

379
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,208
Not to mention keeping
a man who is not dead

380
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,144
under the radar for seven years.

381
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,479
Some very powerful players.

382
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:28,351
Sayed, what do you make
of this mosque right here?

383
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,265
Aksa Mosque. It's one of
the main ones in Sana'a.

384
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:37,001
- It's very distinct.
- Ah.

385
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:40,797
Sightlines seem pretty consistent

386
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,232
with what it would probably be
from the prison to the mosque.

387
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:46,536
Now, you ask me, that photo's legit.

388
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:50,440
Then that's the
building my brother's in.

389
00:25:50,442 --> 00:25:53,476
Easiest way to find out is
to call the prison and ask.

390
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:56,846
Mafi Michael Scofield.

391
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,781
Shukran.

392
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,688
There's no Michael Scofield.

393
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:05,321
Punch up an image from the Internet.

394
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:06,889
Michael Scofield.

395
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:08,124
Send it to the prison.

396
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,993
Maybe he's under a different name.

397
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:11,060
Listen, Linc,

398
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:13,295
I got to say something, man.

399
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:14,831
Man, you got to slow your roll.

400
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,132
Yemen is in a civil war.

401
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:17,967
They're really close to collapse.

402
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:21,070
It's no place for a white
man with an American passport,

403
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,973
no command of Arabic, to
just show up on a whim.

404
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:26,690
And yet, apparently, my brother did.

405
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:29,011
Got a picture. Your
brother's intake photo

406
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:31,481
from the Fox River Penitentiary.

407
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:37,353
Here's his DMV photo

408
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:40,022
and here's a photo from
his old workplace Web site.

409
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:41,591
It's not him.

410
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:43,727
None of them are.

411
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,965
Someone's erasing him from history.

412
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:55,368
- Lincoln, where are you going?
- Hotel, to grab my stuff,

413
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,969
- then the airport.
- Hey, listen.

414
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:58,571
You're not going to Yemen.

415
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:01,173
- Stop me.
- You won't make it three days.

416
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,109
We need to go through
the proper channels.

417
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,510
The proper channels?

418
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:06,846
Someone's erasing his existence.

419
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,881
Who does that? Who has that ability?

420
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:10,282
I'm telling you, Michael's caught

421
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:11,684
in the middle of something big.

422
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:13,452
What if he's not caught in the middle?

423
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,287
What are you saying?

424
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:17,323
Michael has never been anyone's sucker.

425
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:20,259
He's always been in control. Always.

426
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:21,994
You saying he faked his own death?

427
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:23,763
I'm saying you need to look

428
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:25,131
at all of the possibilities

429
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:27,066
before you walk into a war zone.

430
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,047
I wasn't sure you'd come.

431
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:45,584
Sometimes a man has
to surrender to fate.

432
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:49,121
See what it has in store for him.

433
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:54,994
We'll need to put you under.

434
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,697
No, no, no. I don't do
general anesthetic, compadre.

435
00:27:57,699 --> 00:28:00,166
It's mandatory for a
procedure like this.

436
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:01,534
You'll forgive me

437
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,536
if I have a problem lying unconscious

438
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:06,238
before a man with sharp
items at his disposal.

439
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
It cannot be done without
a general anesthetic.

440
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:09,942
Oh, I've done it before, friend.

441
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:11,310
And look what it got you.

442
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:16,515
You do anything untoward to
me while I'm under and I'll...

443
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:18,284
You are the last man I'd run afoul of.

444
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:20,786
- Okay?
- Mm.

445
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:24,824
Oh, fate, you mysterious bitch.

446
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:27,593
Why you doing this to me?

447
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:36,235
Hi. Dry cleaning. Nice jacket.

448
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:37,636
Thank you, sir.

449
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:39,071
Have a good day.

450
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,132
What the hell was that for?

451
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:08,100
Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?

452
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:11,036
C-Note told me what's going on.

453
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:12,838
He tell you to talk me out of it?

454
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,275
No. I'm coming with you.

455
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:17,507
You're not coming.

456
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,378
Michael's my best friend. If he's alive,

457
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,813
if he's in trouble, I want to help.

458
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:22,148
Don't you have a job or something?

459
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,383
Yeah, on a tramp. Not great work,

460
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,818
but hey, I'm an ex-con, right?

461
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,186
Tramp?

462
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:28,521
Yeah, I've been riding her for a while.

463
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:29,855
What are you, a pimp?

464
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:31,757
What? No. No, no, no.

465
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,826
A tramp is a freelance cargo ship.

466
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:36,141
We go to Hong Kong, Spain, Buenos Aires,

467
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:37,445
basically wherever the boss tells us.

468
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:38,879
Corrupt son of a bitch.

469
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:40,132
Well, I suggest you
get back on that tramp,

470
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,516
- 'cause you're not coming.
- I'm telling you,

471
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:44,062
- I can help!
- Listen to me, this is the Middle East.

472
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,172
Lots has changed. I'm an
international hitter now.

473
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:47,506
A raconteur.

474
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,508
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

475
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,377
Don't speak to me like I don't
know French, I know French.

476
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:52,578
And I'm brown, that's something.

477
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,679
I'll fit in better over there

478
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,548
than you will, snowflake.

479
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,183
I decided I was wrong when I said

480
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,084
you would be dead inside of three days.

481
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:02,755
You go over there, you'll
be dead inside of one.

482
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:05,057
But with me, we have
people at the mosque

483
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:06,525
that have worked over there,

484
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:07,927
people with legal connections

485
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:09,562
that can get us inside of that prison.

486
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:12,631
Hold on. You're not
saying he gets to go.

487
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,133
He's not any browner than I am.

488
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:16,435
_

489
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:17,469
Huh?

490
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,171
No?

491
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:21,207
I managed to pick up a little Arabic

492
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:23,108
while I was serving in Iraq.

493
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,244
This is the final boarding
call for Flight 39

494
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,746
to JFK, connecting to Yemen.
This is the final boarding...

495
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:29,448
Listen, man.

496
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,330
There's gonna be a time
when I'm gonna need you.

497
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:38,958
You better find him.

498
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,826
And you better call me when you do.

499
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:42,695
I will.

500
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:48,801
You really got contacts?

501
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,737
Contacts with contacts.

502
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,776
Could just follow 'em into the bathroom,

503
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:00,512
ragdoll him in one of stalls
and be done with it.

504
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:03,015
Then we'd have a body to deal with.

505
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:04,750
And we want him utterly

506
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:08,687
and irrevocably gone from this world.

507
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:12,357
Where no amount of digging
will bring him back.

508
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,793
_

509
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:26,872
We're the only ones
coming into the place.

510
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:28,674
Yeah, the country's falling apart.

511
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,019
Everyone wants out.

512
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,377
Who's that contact again?

513
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:32,611
A woman named Sheba.

514
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:33,589
Our handler.

515
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,347
She helps us track
Americans that come in

516
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:36,648
to fight the jihad fight.

517
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:45,223
Welcome to the civil war.

518
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:48,527
Mr. Franklin,

519
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:50,329
Ms. Sheba sent me to collect you.

520
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,463
As-salaam alaikum.

521
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:52,665
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

522
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,434
Uh, this way, gentlemen. Follow me.

523
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:04,784
_

524
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:10,916
Yemen very dangerous.

525
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:13,786
You never know who's
enemies, who's friends.

526
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:17,389
Everyone scratching each other's backs.

527
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:19,491
ISIL is starting to attack the city.

528
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:22,661
They have been building up
out in the desert for months.

529
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:24,381
If they... take the city,

530
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:26,318
they will kill all the secularists,

531
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,120
install Sharia law.

532
00:32:28,122 --> 00:32:29,655
Huh. You know.

533
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,490
You don't seem worried.

534
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:35,595
I scratch backs, too, my friend.

535
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,606
No, no, no, no. This isn't right.

536
00:32:46,608 --> 00:32:48,274
Hey, wait a minute,

537
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:49,609
this-this isn't the address.

538
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:51,644
- I get cigarettes.
- No, no, you don't.

539
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,479
You take us straight to
the address right now!

540
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:54,513
I-I get cigarettes.

541
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,149
Linc, this is a setup.

542
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:58,584
Grab your bag now.

543
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:24,469
_

544
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,438
_

545
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,440
Greetings from the U.S.
prison system, bitches.

546
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:08,480
What is it?

547
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,004
Someone set us up.

548
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:13,385
Come quickly.

549
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,286
Or we'll all be dead!

550
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:17,122
Go, go. She's one of us.

551
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,375
Come on, grab your
bag. Come on, let's go!

552
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:20,633
How did you find us?

553
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:22,095
A contact at the airport saw you

554
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,097
get into the wrong taxi.

555
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,032
You're lucky I found you.

556
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:29,168
This is very radicalized neighborhood.

557
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,143
Whoever set you up couldn't
have set you up in a worse way.

558
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:39,846
Throw your phones out the window.

559
00:34:39,848 --> 00:34:42,348
I don't want anyone tracking us.

560
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,226
Do it!

561
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,357
Sheba, this is Lincoln.

562
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,060
Lincoln... Sheba.

563
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:21,254
You've been made whole, Mr. Bagwell.

564
00:35:21,256 --> 00:35:24,023
You're free to go.

565
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:30,363
Not till you tell me
what you've put in me.

566
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:32,732
You feel an unease, do you?

567
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:36,202
I'd venture that's what's
always been in you since birth.

568
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:39,355
Your soul. I just put
the hardware into you.

569
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:41,658
You're the thing that runs it.

570
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,044
- Who's behind...
- Nobody!

571
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,646
Nobody's behind this.

572
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,649
What does that mean?

573
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:52,018
I got a single word. That's it.

574
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,254
Just... my benefactors ID'd
themselves by a single word.

575
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:56,789
Outis.

576
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,991
I looked it up.

577
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:02,128
It's Greek for "nobody."

578
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:09,335
That's who your
benefactor is, Mr. Bagwell.

579
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,405
Nobody.

580
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:43,460
_

581
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,741
Okay.

582
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:49,976
Who's this?

583
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:53,413
Omar has connections in Ogygia Prison.

584
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:55,047
He says he can arrange a visit.

585
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,282
That mean Michael's in there?

586
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:57,550
There's apparently an American

587
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:58,518
in there matching

588
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,685
your brother's description.

589
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,320
There's just one thing.

590
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:05,491
Arranging such a visit
is hard. Very difficult.

591
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:07,460
- Comes at a price.
- Money's not a problem.

592
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:09,061
Not money.

593
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,743
Your passport.

594
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:12,445
My passport?

595
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:13,399
What, did...

596
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:16,202
- you want to hold it?
- No. Straight trade.

597
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:18,037
Visit for your passport.

598
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:21,040
Uh, U.S. passport is like gold here.

599
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,743
A few changes, and it can
be a ticket to freedom.

600
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,411
Don't do it, Linc.

601
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:26,813
Mm-mm.

602
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,285
I know it is not ideal, but...

603
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:35,188
ideals as of right now
are history in Yemen.

604
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:38,776
You cannot get out of the country

605
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:40,560
without a passport.

606
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,495
Don't do it.

607
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:51,471
Inshallah...

608
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:53,511
you will see your brother soon.

609
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:04,750
I told myself I'd never
step foot in another prison.

610
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:07,487
As long as we walk out of it.

611
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,333
_

612
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:55,701
There's no Michael Scofield.

613
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:58,237
It was a scam to get my passport.

614
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,373
Omar is one of my
most trusted operators.

615
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:02,174
Listen, lady. Trust doesn't seem to mean

616
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,442
a whole lot in this country.

617
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:04,610
Give me a second, okay?

618
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:06,512
I'll figure out a way
to work this thing out.

619
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,147
An image.

620
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,638
Right? The one that they sent to you?

621
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,140
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Do you have it?

622
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:15,621
Look.

623
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,127
There.

624
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,092
Kaniel Outis.

625
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:22,995
Yes, Kaniel Outis. Is he here?

626
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:33,506
He says, yes, the man
in the picture is here

627
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:35,775
and we can see him, but only
'cause we're dealing with Sheba.

628
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:37,076
Why did you say that name?

629
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:38,811
Because of my brother's jacket.

630
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:41,147
Thought you were on the
right side of God on this.

631
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,115
Sheba. No, hey, hey. Sheba...

632
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:48,888
Hey. Kaniel Outis

633
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,423
is a big-time terrorist.

634
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,924
They got him in here for murder.

635
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,225
He's been working with ISIL

636
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:54,660
trying to take down the government.

637
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,262
Come on, C.

638
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:58,464
You know that's not Michael.

639
00:39:58,466 --> 00:40:00,866
Well, whoever he is...

640
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,170
...we're about to meet him.

641
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,640
What was my father like?

642
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,777
My real father.

643
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,417
Michael Scofield...

644
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:22,221
...was like a storm.

645
00:40:23,558 --> 00:40:24,890
Grab the camera.

646
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,659
I want to prove he's alive.

647
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:33,065
He was beautiful

648
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:36,402
and frightening

649
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:38,638
and mysterious.

650
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:42,375
And he would show up in your life

651
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:44,443
out of the clear blue sky

652
00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:49,248
and then he would
disappear just as quickly.

653
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,024
But storms, they can come back.

654
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:53,579
Can't they?

655
00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:56,555
Mm-hmm.

656
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:03,462
Question is, if they come back,

657
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:06,799
is it the same storm,

658
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:09,201
or has something changed?

659
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,541
Michael.

660
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,097
New tats.

661
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,853
What do you mean, new?

662
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:29,722
We're gonna get you out of here.

663
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,427
My name isn't Michael.

664
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:36,650
And I don't know who you are.

665
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:42,038
Sorry.

666
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:47,806
_

667
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,608
Michael.

668
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,426
Michael.

669
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,128
Michael, talk to me. Michael...

670
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,730
Mike.

671
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:12,732
Mike! What are you doing, damn it?!

672
